So, how does GraphQL accomplish this? There are many ways to implement architecture around it…GraphQL server with a connected database. This is a single Web server that implements the GraphQL specification, where when a query payload is read and processed by the server, it fetches the required information from the database. Then it constructs the response object as described in the specification and returns it to the user. GraphQL can be used with any available network protocol, whether it’s TCP, WebSockets, etc…',
